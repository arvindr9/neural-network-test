My first neural net

This is a neural network in progress for letter classification. 

This file includes data sets I have been playing around with like a classifier of images from Andrew Ng's Deep Learning Specialization (deciding whether or not the images are of cats) and a multiclass seperator of nonlinear data, similar to Andrej Karpathy's <a href = "http://cs231n.github.io/neural-networks-case-study/"> minimal neural network case study</a>.
